Embed Comic Metadata
===========================

This plugin embeds the calibre metadata into cbz comic files.
It supports writing to the zip-comment (Comicbook Lover style metadata)
and writing a ComicInfo.xml file into the cbz (ComicRack style)

It also can import the metadata from cbz and cbr into calibre.
